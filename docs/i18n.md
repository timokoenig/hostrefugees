# i18n

The app uses [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) for internationalization. We want to offer this website to as many people as possible therefore native translations are important. We welcome anyone to help us translate this app. To do so, follow these steps:

1. If the language does not exist, create a folder in _/translations_ and copy the files _/translations/en/common.json_ and _/translations/en/country.json_ in that folder
2. Translate the existing values in those files and make sure you do not change the key
3. Save and commit your changes

Note: If you do not add a translation in any given language, the app will default to English.
